### zig-gmp


This library provides a wrapper around libgmp for use in the Zig build system.

Zig version required: 0.14.0

Libgmp version packaged: 6.3.0

Currently supported targets (the main problem with supporting new targets is that I need to manually run `m4` to generate the assembly files, since there does't exist an `m4` wrapper for the Zig build system yet).
